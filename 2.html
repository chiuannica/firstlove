			Yesterday, he called me and told me long distance wasn't going well for him. Me neither. So he said it might not work out. Was he dumping me right there? No, he wasn't. He was just saying it. I told him I didn't want to break up. He didn't either. Good.

			Hearing him tell me he's scared we won't make it sucks. I get it. He is in another city, doing hard things in college. I get it!  Long distance isn't fun. Partners are supposed to see each other often. The last thing I want to drive us apart is school. I'd rather break up because he found a new girl. I want him to be happy.

			Relationships are like the Eiffel Tower. Paris was already unique before it was built. The city doesn't need the tower. It's a building that serves no purpose. Now it’s there, and you can't imagine France without it.

			The feelings were too real. We got together anyway.

			Yes. I shed a few tears. I'm okay though.

		<div class="container50">
			Yes! Breaking up would suck.

		<div class="container50">
			Yes. I knew this was coming when we got together.

			If we break up, I'll always treasure what we had. I know that we will have a clean breakup.
