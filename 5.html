			I never finished writing the end because I wasn’t ready to move on at all. I'm still really sad. It’s still fresh, and it will be for a while.

			 I still hold on to some kind of hope. I convince myself that if we are meant to be, we will find each other. I’m not a fan of waiting though. 		</div>

			Then I said that we skyped on Thursday, three days before we broke up, and I didn't notice anything different. I was happy to see him like always. He had physics homework and I was keeping him from that. He was too busy for me. And I was too. I had work to do too, but I didn’t because he was so enticing to look at.
